%\section{Ontology}

\abstract{
\noindent
For the course Open Information Systems we first proposed an application for users to keep track of the desired amount of calories a user needs to eat in a day. A conceptual schema was made and we created a database and populated it. This application was used as a base to make an ontology with the different groups participating in the course Open Information Systems. We proposed and implemented a non-trivial demonstrator that used this ontology.}

\section{Introduction}
In this report, we look back at the previous stages of the assignments and we have made adaptations to our work where necessary. This includes the conceptual schema, the database, the ontology made with the entire group. Furthermore this report also describes the mapping of the ontology to our database. To show how the ontology can be used we proposed and made a non-trivial demonstrator.

\subsection{Person} 

We base our application on a person which has as unique identifier an e-mail address. We provide basic information about the user for instance, its  name, height in centimeters, gender, birth date. The gender of a user can be either female or male. A user has an exercise level, this can be high, low or average. This exercise level is important since the amount of calories a user needs in a day is dependent on the amount of exercise the person does. An active person will need a higher amount of calories in a day. Since the application needs to be able to show the fluctuation of the weight of a person, we keep track of how much a person weighs on a specific date. The unit used for the weight of a person is kg.  In order to calculate the daily amount of calories the user needs in order to stay on the same weight, we use the following formula: \newline
Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) of a man= 10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(y) + 5 \newline
Basal Metabolic Rate of a  woman = 10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(y) - 161 \newline
In order to calculate the amount of calories a person needs we need to multiply this BMR with 1.3; if the exercise level of the person is light. Multiply it with 1.6; if the exercise level is average and multiply it with 2.1; if the exercise level is high. The user's latest weight is used as the weight. This daily calorie amount is derived and not stored. A user also has the possibility to give a weight loss/gain amount, starting at a specific date for a period of days. Then the weight in the formula to calculate the needed calorie amount is adapted to the desired weight. 

\subsection{Ingredient}
The application has a list of ingredients, identified by their name. It also keep track of the amount of calories for 100 gram of the ingredient. An ingredient can be part of a recipe. In that case we also keep track of how much of the ingredient is needed.

\subsection{Recipe}
 A recipe has an amount of calories, which is the sum of all ingredients with their calories. Recipes can be easily found with a tag. This tag can be general and includes for instance breakfast but also more specific, for example; Chinese or Italian. A recipe can be part of another recipe for example the recipe for spaghetti sauce is part of the recipe for lasagna. In that case we also keep track of the amount of the recipe that is needed.   


\section{Database}
Based on this conceptual schema, a relational database schema was created. For this we used a MySQL relational database.As seen in the SQL statement, we used id's to create primary keys for the different concepts (person, recipe, ingredient and tag). This because it is more efficient and more clear to reference different concepts in the relation tables. These are then used as primary keys within the different relations among the concepts. In the persons table a few encodings are used. For one gender is marked by a single character m or f for either male or female. The level of exercise is encoded as an integer from low to high between 1 and 3.\\

\section{Ontology}

\subsection{Organization}

In order to be able to communicate easily between the different groups we decided, after some initial contact on Facebook, to create a slack channel. This channel was created by Sander Lenearts and at least one person from each group was contacted so all the groups and all their members could join. This slack channel has as an advantage that it was possible to start an initial discussion during the vacation period without having to have everybody physically present at the same place. It was also possible to discus between the food and exercise groups, while providing the option to pin certain decisions and files.\\ \\
We also used Google Doc files that allows for collaboration on a single document. This was used to type out the glossaries, definitions and conceptual schema's.

\subsection{Meetings}

In the first meeting that took place on slack. We wanted to create a global ontology. The only thing that both the food groups and the exercises groups had in common was energy. We decided on a definition that both had a relationship to food and to exercises without getting too technical. Another point of discussion was the unit. Some people wanted to have the SI unit (Joule) but since the unit calories is more widely used, it was decided to use calories as unit. Since there were no more commonalities, we decided to work with the food group separately. This was done in a different slack channel where each group was identified using a separate avatar. 
\newline
\newline
\noindent
The second slack meeting, for the food team, there was at least one member of every group besides group 8. We started with a definition for an Ingredient. A huge point of discussion was whether an Ingredient had a brand. Group 5 really wanted this incorporated while this was the only group that needed this aspect. It was proposed that the brand could be part of a more specialised ontology but group 5 didn't agree with this so it was decided that brands would be part of it but, clearly stating that they were an optional property. Since slack has as drawback that it doesn't keep the complete channel history (in the free version) and since discussions on slack can be rather uncoordinated we decided to have the next meeting face to face. 
\newline
\newline
\noindent
Every group had to prepare a glossary and search for entities in their database. During this meeting, that took place Monday 11 April in the morning, all groups but one, group 8, were represented by at least one member. Group 8 did not reply in the slack-channel, the Facebook chat or on the forum on PointCarr\'e. We discussed other ways of contacting them, and decided we would personally contact them during another class. During this meeting we discussed the first food ontology. There was a discussion about whether only to incorporate calories or if other nutritious values were necessary as well. In the end we decided to go with the definition that group 7 proposed since every group was able to map on this definition and since this was the design that was general enough so that the ontology could be easier to reuse. The incorporation of recipe, food and ingredient, and their relation was one of the easiest to decide on. Furthermore we discussed that everybody had some kind of concept to describe either ingredients or recipes, tags in our case. But since the definition of this was so different for each group we settled on not including them at this point in our ontology and we noted that we can always come back to it. During this meeting the focus however did seem to be a lot on how our databases were designed and sometimes group 5 did seem to focus too much on their specific implementation. After agreeing on most definitions and almost finishing the basic ontology, someone noticed that calories is not a nutritional value. We had a discussion whether we should change it and put calorie in the ingredient entity or leave it that way. Where group 5 proposed to put calories in ingredients and have an extra data property that would enable us to use the energetic value of an ingredient in joule or in kCal. Because calories did fit our personal definition of nutritional values, we left it the way we first agreed to it because every group could map onto this ontology. The collaboration went good and we had one person typing our glossary in a Google doc while somebody else drew the different entities on the blackboard. 
\newline
\newline
\noindent
During the evening meeting of Monday 11 April, every group was present but group 8. During this meeting we had the intend to put the ontology in  WebProtégé. We encountered some difficulties with the platform and decided to ask for more information and get together another day. 
\newline
\newline
\noindent
We tried having another meeting on Wednesday 13 April where group 2 and group 1 tried putting the ontology in WebProtégé. Since we still encountered problems we decided to send another mail for more information and ask extra information during the next class of Open Information Systems. 
\newline
\newline
\noindent
During the meeting of Monday 18 April, after having asked questions during the classes that day, all groups were present. We put the ontology in the local version of Protégé. Furthermore we had an extra discussion since we didn't want to have calories in the nutritional value since we didn't like the fact that calories weren't in fact nutritional values. Group 5 also brought up that they didn't like the relationship with amount/nutritional value since it was too complex. They proposed (again) to have an extra data property \emph{energy} on the ingredient class. After hearing the arguments it was decided to change the name, since calories aren't nutrients. But to keep the relationship with amount(changed name to quantity since this is more informative)/nutritional value since this one is more general. We like to note that while groups 8 and 4 where present they didn't have any input.\\ \\
We also faced the issue of adding an extra class between ingredient and nutritional value. This is not strictly necessary but because we also had a \emph{linking} class between recipe and ingredient we decided to add this as well. This because otherwise ingredient class would have a data property amount, which is not very generic as other applications might be interested in only the ingredient class. During this meeting some name changes where made because they where clearer.

\subsection{Extra adaptations} 
Another discussion took place on slack where it was proposed to give a name to individual recipes. Since food already has a name and a recipe leads to a food we decided to keep the name in food and not give it an individual name. Furthermore group 7 revisited the idea that calorie as part of the nutritive value was not the way to go. It was then decided that defining calorie as an individual made more sense.


\subsection{Other discussions}
We discussed what other groups had in common with our proposal. Because there where no things that where worthwhile exchanging we did not add an extra ontology.
\newline
\newline
\noindent
We had the discussion with all of the groups whether or not we should exchange information about our users or the accounts. We did not see any benefits and for privacy reasons for the user we decided not to exchange user information and therefore not include this in the ontology. 

\subsection{Ontology explained}
The ontology is centred around the ingredient class. An ingredient was the thing we all had in common to start with. Ingredients have nutritional values like sugar, salt and calories, specified in the list of nutritive values. We have decided to make an extra class nutritive value to specify this. Because we need to be able to have multiple nutritive values for one ingredient, we have added the nutritive value quantity. This was necessary for some of the groups in order to be able to map to the ontology. Here you can specify the quantity specified for a nutritive value for 100 gram.
\\ \\
Ingredients can also be combined into a recipe. We have also added an ingredient quantity class for the same reason we added the nutritive value quantity. A recipe can have multiple ingredients combined. The ingredient quantity class specifies the quantity needed for the ingredient in a specific recipe. We have also provided the unit of quantity. Combining some ingredients result into a recipe. The result of a recipe is something that we can eat so we have classified this as food. There is also a possibility to provide steps in order to complete a recipe. Steps consists of an ordering number and the description of the step. 
\\ \\
Because we have made this decision, all groups can map onto it. In our case, not every ingredient is combined into a recipe but it is still food. Therefore we can say for example, one apple is the ingredient for eating an apple, it does not specify any steps. Via this way we can say that an apple is a food.
\\ \\
We did not add a link between food and ingredient. This is because in the Open World Assumption a food can also be an ingredient. Initially it was provided to add a link but some groups protested because they did not see the benefit of it so we left it out. 

\section{Glossary}
\textit{Recipe} \\
A collection of ingredients and/or the steps necessary to combine the ingredients into some food. It contains a list of ingredients with their quantity, a list of steps to complete the recipe and a link to food. \\ \\
\textit{Food} \\
Any substance that can be eaten or drunk. When consumed, it provides a nutrition. Food can be an ingredient or the result of a recipe. It only has a name. \\ \\
\textit{Ingredient} \\
An ingredient is a substance containing nutrients; an ingredient can be a food. It contains an optional brand, a name and a list of nutritive values with their quantity. \\ \\
\textit{Ingredient Quantity} \\
The link between a recipe and an ingredient. 
It depicts the amount of some ingredient necessary to complete a recipe.
It contains a reference to the ingredient, a quantity and the unit for which the quantity is specified. This can be liter, a table spoon or something similar.
\\ \\
\textit{Nutritive value} \\
A substance that provides nourishment essential for the maintenance of life and for growth. For example fat, sugar, carbohydrate, protein, sodium. This contains only a name. \\ \\
\textit{Nutritive Value Quantity} \\
The link between a nutrition and an ingredient. 
It depicts the amount of some nutrient per 100 gram of some ingredient. This contains an ID of nutritive value, a quantity and the unit for which the quantity is specified.\\ \\
\textit{Recipe Step} \\
A step in the preparation process of a recipe. A step has a ordering number starting from 1. A step has a number for ordering and a string as a human readable description. This contains an order number which specifies the order of the steps and a description.

\section{Mapping database to ontology}
The mapping of the database to the ontology went quite easy. In general the mapping was straightforward. We did however decide to map Ingredient to Food. This decision was made since since our definition of Ingredients matched the definition of food and we don't have food. Furthermore in our database the quantity of an ingredient for which we keep the calories is always 100 gram. Since our recipes don't have steps we didn't provide a mapping for these. 
\\ \\
Since we need a lot of data to query, we asked the other food-groups to exchange their generated triples. Some exercise groups also wanted to use the triples of the food groups. Therefore, our group decided to put messages on the slack channel, the Facebook group and on the Pointcarré-forum of the course to ask for the different groups triples. We put the message on the different forums to reach as much people as possible. We assumed that other groups would benefit from the exchange of triples, but the response wasn't what was expected. A possible reason is that some of the groups weren't done with their triples.
\\ \\
From the food groups, only group 1 and group 5 asked to use our triples, and one exercises group. We have send them our ttl-file. In response we got the ttl-files from group 7 and group 5. One problem with these files however was that each separate group used their own namespace for the ontology, which didn't make the ttl-files globally usable. We solved this by editing the triples of other groups to use the same namespace.

\section{Non-trivial demonstrator}
Our demonstration allows to formulate a number of health and dieting constraints (has to consume a number of calories, cant eat too much salt, is allergic to nuts, ...) and search for fitting recipes. Our demonstration allows to easily fill in these constraints and suggests a number of recipes that fit these needs. Users can combine constraints in a "and-or-not" kind of fashion. For example a user cannot eat too much fat combined with too much sugar, he is also allergic to bananas. This would result in a rule; fat lower than 30g or sugar lower than 20g and no bananas. In addition to this user can express preferences, for example a user dislikes broccoli but likes fries. Recipes with broccoli will be ranked lower than recipes with fries.
\\ \\
This demonstration uses the developed ontology and thus also databases of other teams. Since the ontology provides the ingredients for each recipe as well as their nutritive values this can be done. In our original application (and database) we don't provide nutritive values other than calories. Therefore we will need to query other projects SPARQL endpoints, which will hopefully provide these values. We plan to use a rule system to indicate whether a recipe is favourable, unfavourable or neutral for a certain set of preferences.

\subsection{Rule based languages}
Because we have to define some rules and queries, we needed a rule based language to define those things. We looked at two different rule based languages, SPIN and SWRL.
\subsection*{SPIN}
The first rule based language is SPIN, SPARQL Inference Notation. The rules in this language can be expressed using SPARQL, which is very expressive. The SPARQL queries can also be expressed in SPIN triples. Therefore rules can run on RDF data, in our case our triples. With SPIN, you can infer triples and properties for example the difference in weight of a person in a specific period. In SPIN it is also possible to define a number or constraints which can be applied to 
\\ \\ 
SPIN uses the concepts of object orieted languages, query languages and rule based systems. They use SPARQL because it is a WC3 standard and already known by a lot of developers.
SPIN makes it also possible to create templates. This has as advantage that the designers of the rules and constraint do not need to know SPARQL. In our case, this not necessary because we are defining the rules and the queries for the non-trivial demonstrator. 

An example of an ask-query converted to SPIN notation is defined below in listing 1.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example of query using SPIN}]
[ a       sp:Ask ;
      rdfs:comment "must be at least 18 years old"^^xsd:string ;
      sp:where ([ sp:object _:b1 ;
                  sp:predicate ex:age ;
                  sp:subject spin:_this
                ] [ a       sp:Filter ;
                    sp:expression
                            [ a       sp:ge ;
                              sp:arg1 _:b1 ;
                              sp:arg2 18
                            ]
                ])
    ]
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection*{SWRL}
The second rule based language is SWRL, Semantic Web Rule Language. It is a combination of OWL DL and OWL Lite. It combines Horn-like rules with OWL knowledge base. The rules are expressed like in Prolog with a head and a body. This means that if all conditions in the body hold, the conditions in the head also holds. 

An example of a rule is specified in listing 2.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example of query using SWRL}]
Implies(Antecedent(Artist(I-variable(x)) 
		   artistStyle(I-variable(x) I-variable(y))
		   Style(I-variable(y))
		   creator(I-variable(z) I-variable(x)))
	Consequent(style/period(I-variable(z) I-variable(y))))
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Choice}
Because we've already used SPARQL for this project, we have chosen for SPIN to be our rule based language. Because you can define templates which can be reused and because you can define constraints, we chose SPIN over SWRL. Furthermore SPIN has a ConstraintViolationLevel which makes it possible for us to define different levels of constraints, which is useful to implement the hard and soft constraints. SWRL is a good language for inferring new triples, but because we do not necessarily need this, we have chosen SPIN.
\\ \\ 
We have used Jena as a Java API to upload our data sets, which were all the sets of the food groups, and to query SPARQL queries on the data sets. We have also used Jena Fuseki to test different queries through the provided web GUI. 

\subsection{Non-trivial demonstrator}
Our demonstrator is implemented as a Java application which can be used as a commandline tool. It has dependencies on the Jena API\footnote{\url{https://jena.apache.org/}}, SPIN open source API\footnote{\url{http://topbraid.org/spin/api/}} and the Antlr parser library\footnote{\url{http://www.antlr.org/}}. As said in the previous section we used SPIN to implement our demonstrator. For our demonstrator we implemented two SPIN constraints, one to filter recipes that contain a certain ingredient and one to filter recipes that contain too much of a certain nutritive value. These constraint were abstracted using SPIN templates. This allows to use parameters such as the nutrient name or the nutrient value. We also added a parameter to indicate a certain violation level\footnote{\url{http://spinrdf.org/spin.html\#spin-constraint-construct}}. This parameter was used to differentiate between hard and soft constraints. To apply these SPIN constraints, a constraint had to be added to the Recipe class defined in the ontology as shown below:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example of applying constraints in turtle]
ont:Recipe  
  spin:constraint  [ a ont:templateIngre ;
                     ont:parIngredient  "Tomato" ;
                     ont:parWarn        spin:Warning
                   ] ;
  spin:constraint  [ a ont:templateNut ;
                     ont:parNutrient  "Cholesterol" ;
                     ont:parValue     "4"^^xsd:int ;
                     ont:parWarn      spin:Error
                   ] .
\end{lstlisting} 
These applications are added to the model at run time by the java code. Thereafter all the models containing triples are united and the SPIN constraint check method will produce a list of constraint violations. These are then looped over and divided in hard and soft constraint violations. Then all recipes (except the ones that violate a hard constraint) are queried and displayed to the user.\\
The constraints can be expressed using a simple language which is defined as seen below. With the Antlr library a walker can be generated. In this walker at the end of each constraint, a method is called which adds this constraint to the model. 
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example of the constraints file]{Name}
HARD "Cholesterol" < 4 AND
SOFT not "Tomato" 
\end{lstlisting}
There were some issues that occurred during the implementation of the demonstrator. We wanted to allow for a and-or type of chaining of constraints. This was however difficult as the SPIN constraints don't allow for this kind of functionality. A solution would be to define ID's to each constraint and then check within the java code. But the SPIN open source API (which is not documented) does not allow to retrieve additional properties given to a constraint.\\
We also tried to implement different kind of operators for the nutrient constraint (e.g. smaller than, equals). But because the constraints are implemented in SPARQL and it is not possible to use a variables as operator, this was not possible. We tried to use the SPIN SPARQL syntax but the syntax for operators is undocumented (however some operators are shown in the examples) and support for it in the open source API is lacking at this time.\\
For future work this demonstrator could be expanded by adding more constraints (e.g. limiting the amount of steps in a recipe). A larger amount of constraints would indicate that more abstract templates can be defined (now only two separate templates exist). Further more the rule system in SPIN could be used to infer properties (e.g. recipe length).

\section{Reflection}
During the project, we have encountered some problems and some findings that could have been done in another way next time. 
\subsection*{Database} 
Our database provides recipes, but these do not contain any steps. We have noticed that every other group that has recipes, do specify the steps in order to complete the recipe. We thought that only providing the ingredients would be enough and that users could look up the recipe. Looking back these steps are something that we should add to our applications database. Furthermore we would also add the possibility to safe the calories for a different unit than just 100 grams. 
\subsection*{Ontology} 
Working together with a big group does not speaks for itself. We have noticed that during the face to face meetings a lot of work could be done, but we have only started to meet face to face rather late and not every group was present. It would have been better if we agreed on a date as soon as we got the assignment to meet face to face even before the holidays.  
\\ \\  
Although every group participated and checked the ontology, we missed something. We forgot to give a recipe a name. This way we could add different recipes for the same food. For our group, this was not a problem, because we mapped every recipe on food as well and food contains a name. 
\subsection*{Non-trivial demonstrator}
When looking into SPIN it seemed a perfect fit for the demonstrator we wanted to implement. However the lack of documentation of the open source API and the lack of documentation surrounding the operators made implementing all of our goals impossible. SPIN is a good fit for these kind of projects because of its relation with SPARQL, but the implementation and documentation of the API could be a lot better at this point in time.

\section{Team Organisation}

Since Arno De Witte was busy during spring break, both Jolien Declerck and Silke Verhaeghe attended the first two slack meetings and the first real life meeting. In case we weren't sure of certain aspects we could always reach Arno and a global overview of the decisions was given after each meeting. For the rest of the meetings everyone of our group was present. Arno was the one to apply the remarks of the teacher to our current database/Conceptual schema. The group came together to discuss which non trivial demonstrator would be implemented. Furthermore doing the mapping and creating the triples was a group effort. Jolien and Arno looked into the different Rule based languages. The implementation of the non-trivial demonstrator was done by Arno De Witte. The final report was written as a group.
